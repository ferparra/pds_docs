# This is the “Fine Print” you really need to read!

- Terms, conditions, limits and sub-limits apply to everything – that is why it is important **you** read this booklet very carefully.
- Exclusions apply that restrict, limit and/or exclude cover. Read the [General exclusions](about:blank#general-exclusions) and the exclusions under each benefit section carefully to see what **we** don’t cover.
- **We** have made this policy to give **you** choice and flexibility while **you** are on **your journey**.

>

- pay for Daily Boosts to do things like skiing or motorcycling – **you** pay-per-day.

> In any case, you must pay the extra premium for any Daily Boost before 00.00am (midnight) Australian Eastern Standard Time (AEST) for that cover to apply from midnight AEST.
> 

### For example

> If you are in Bali now and want to ride a motorcycle tomorrow (after midnight AEST), you need to buy the Daily Boost before midnight AEST today.

> 
- Khalida’s mother had been unwell for several months and was booked to have medical tests. Khalida organised a holiday and purchased a policy. Unfortunately, the test results showed her mother had a serious sickness so Khalida cancelled her holiday

> to spend time with her mother. Because her
> 
> 
> mother was having tests after being unwell when Khalida bought her policy, her claim would not be covered as she knew at that time, or a person in her circumstances would have reasonably known or foreseen, that she may need to cancel her trip due to her mother’s health.

## Duty to take reasonable care not to make a misrepresentation

This is a consumer insurance contract under the Insurance Contracts Act 1984 (Cth) (Act).

Under the Act, **you** have a duty to take reasonable care not to make a misrepresentation to **us**.

This duty applies whenever **you** enter into, renew, extend or vary this contract of insurance. In all cases, **we** will ask **you** questions that are relevant to **our** decision to insure **you** and on what terms.

It is important that **you** understand **you** are answering **our** questions in this way for **yourself** and anyone else that **you** want to be covered by the contract.

When **you** answer the questions **you** must give a true and accurate account of matters. **Your**

response should tell **us** everything that **you** know about the question because **your** response is relevant to whether **we** offer **you** insurance and the terms **we** offer **you**.

A misrepresentation made fraudulently is made in breach of the duty to take reasonable care not to make a misrepresentation.

### Circumstances relevant to your duty

Whether or not **you** took reasonable care not to make a misrepresentation will be determined with regard to all the relevant circumstances.

If **we** know, or ought to know about **your** particular characteristics or circumstances, **we** will consider these to determine if **you** took reasonable care not to make a misrepresentation to **us**.

**We** may consider the following matters to determine if **you** took reasonable care not to make a misrepresentation to **us**:

- the type of consumer insurance contract in question, and its target market;
- explanatory material or publicity produced or authorised by **us**;
- how clear, and how specific, the questions **we**

> asked were;
> 
- how clearly **we** communicated to **you** the importance of answering those questions and the possible consequences of failing to do so;
- whether or not an agent/insurance broker was acting for **you**; or
- whether the contract was a new contract or was being renewed, extended, varied or reinstated.

**You** are not to be taken to have made a misrepresentation merely because **you**:

- failed to answer a question; or
- gave an obviously incomplete or irrelevant answer to a question.

### Consequences if you fail to take reasonable care and do make a misrepresentation

If **you** do not take reasonable care when answering **our** questions and the result is **you** do make a misrepresentation to **us**, **we** may cancel **your** contract or reduce the amount **we** will pay **you** if **you** make a claim, or both.

If **your** failure to take reasonable care not to make a misrepresentation to us is fraudulent, **we** may refuse to pay a claim and treat the contract as if it never existed.

## When and how benefits are provided

The benefits for which **you** are insured under this policy are payable:

- when an insured event occurs during the **period of insurance** causing **you** to suffer loss or damage or incur legal liability; and
- **your** claim is accepted by **us**.

> After calculating the amount payable we will either:
> 
- pay for specified **additional** expenses;
- pay the person or provider to whom **you** are legally liable;
- pay the cash value, repair cost or arrange replacement of **your** personal items (after deducting depreciation where applicable); or
- pay **you**.

## The amount you pay for this insurance

The amount **we** charge **you** for this insurance policy is the total amount of the **premium** that **we** calculate to cover the risk and any relevant government charges (such as Goods and Services Tax (GST) and stamp duty). These amounts add up to the total amount **you** must pay.

> Once the policy is issued your total premium and any relevant government charges are shown on the Certificate of Insurance. If you wish to change your policy in any way please contact us.
> 

## How various factors affect the amount payable

> We consider a number of factors in calculating the total amount payable. The following is a guide on these key factors, how they combine and how they may impact the assessment of risk and therefore your premium.
> 
- Area – higher risk areas cost more.
- Departure date and trip duration – the longer the period until **you** depart and the longer **your** trip duration, the higher the cost may be.
- Age – higher risk age groups cost more.
- Selected **Boosts** (e.g. cancellation and amendment, cruise) – additional **premium** may apply.

## How a claim settlement is calculated

When **we** pay a claim **we** consider a number of aspects in calculating the settlement. These include:

- the amount of loss or damage or liability;
- the excess;
- the maximum benefit limits and sub-limits;
- reasonable depreciation; and
- the terms and conditions of the policy.

The following example illustrates how **we** will calculate claim settlement.

- **Your** new video camera with an original purchase price of $2,800 is stolen from a hotel room
- **You** are travelling on an Overseas Trip with the Luggage Basic and Gadget **Boosts**.
- An Overseas Trip has an excess of $100.

The claim settlement would be calculated as follows:

- Consider the original purchase price of the video camera – $2,800 (no depreciation applies because the video camera was new).
- Consider the maximum benefit limit for Luggage Basic – $5,000
- Consider the maximum item limit payable for cameras and video cameras under the

> Gadget Boost – $4,000. The claimed item is lower than the limit.
> 
- As **your** excess of $100 is deducted. This results in a claim settlement of $2,700 or **we** may choose to replace the item

Depreciation applies.

### Claim example:

## Helpful tips

### **Cruising Cover- mandatory if you’re travelling on a multi-night cruise***

For the purposes of this insurance, a multi-night cruise is a trip involving an ocean, river or sea voyage of more than two nights in total duration, where transportation and accommodation

is primarily on an ocean, river or sea going passenger ship. Multi-night cruises include voyages:

- that don’t stop at any port along the way e.g. a cruise out to sea for three nights and back;
- on a vessel to various ports e.g. sailing in Croatia, a river cruise in Europe; and
- those on a cruise ship around the same country e.g. Australia: Sydney-Hobart (select “South West Pacific Cruise” as the destination) or USA: Hawaiian Island cruises.

For any of these, an Overseas Trip Cover with Cruise **Boost** is required.

> *For a multi-night cruise within Australia, in the Kimberley region or on the Murray River for example, a Domestic policy may be purchased and no Cruising Boost is required.
> 

### **Reciprocal Healthcare Agreement**

The Australian Government and the

governments of certain countries have an agreement where Australian residents are provided with subsidised essential medical treatment (which, in turn, minimises **your**

claim with **us**). The agreement is known as a

Reciprocal Healthcare Agreement (RHA). Please visit [humanservices.gov.au/medicare](http://humanservices.gov.au/medicare) or

[servicesaustralia.gov.au/reciprocal-health-care-](http://servicesaustralia.gov.au/reciprocal-health-care-agreements) [agreements](http://servicesaustralia.gov.au/reciprocal-health-care-agreements) for details of RHAs with Australia.
